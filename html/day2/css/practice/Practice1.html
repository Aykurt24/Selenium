        I live in village and happy whit it. I have a chance to buy
        fresh milk, egg, vegetables ect. Also there is no air and
        noise pollution in my village that's why i do not feel tired
        and can wake up early in the morning.
        What i believe to start day early is really good. I can do many
        things before noon so have a chance to hang out around the my
        village.
